In order to run the script, cd into this folder, and type 'make'.

Adjust the initial condition in "initial.in" to your liking.
Keep in mind that internally, the code works with G = 1.
The input is entered in following order: 

    mass x0 y0 vx0 vy0
    
Example: the following inputs will create loop orbits.

    1 2 0 0 0.5
or
    1 3 0 0 -1

Example: the following inputs will create box orbits.

    1 2 0 0 1
or
    1 1.1 0 0 1
    
Then run the Orbit.py script. t_begin, t_end and dt are manually adjusted inside the script.

The output is ordered as such:

    time energy Lz mass x y vx vy
